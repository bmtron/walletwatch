## WalletWatch

Welcome to WalletWatch, the app that helps you keepm track of daily one-offs, the things that you don't think about buying (like coffee or a bag of chips), but really add up over the course of a month.

To access the live version, click [here](https://walletwatch.now.sh).

That link should bring you to the landing page, which gives a brief description of the app, and provides
a link to either login (if you already have an account) or to register for a new account. 

Landing Page: ![screenshot of landing page](https://i.gyazo.com/f6fdc9ece4e4415457e6ae646a3af513.jpg)

There is also a demo account listed if you just want to check it out without the hassle of creating an 
account.

Once you register an account and login, you will be taken to the main budget page, where you can set your net income, and add in your big monthly expenses, things that you know are going to come around every month that MUST get paid, like your mortgage, or utilities.

From here, you can add your big monthly items to get an idea of what your spending looks like and to see your disposable income. You can also click on the 'Daily Expenditures' button to be taken to the Daily Expense page.

Here is where you'll keep track of all of those small things you buy throughout the month, like your morning energy drink, or perhaps that trip to your favorite fast food joint every Friday. This page will show you the impact these small purchases have by the week and by the month. Once added to the page, your disposable income will be recalculated to show you how much is left after all of your purchases, giving you and idea of what you could save by trimming a few simple items a day!

## Technology

WalletWatch was created with a multitude of different technologies. The client was built using HTML5 and CSS for the skeleton and skin, respectively, and uses React.js to deliver the main functionality. The backend uses Node.js and Express, and uses PostgreSQL as the database.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
